# M5PaperMpdCli

 Simple WiFi M5Paper MPD client (Arduino) for Moode player or other MPD based players.

 It's basically an "always on" version of my similar M5 Core2 project. The E-paper allows me to keep the display always up-to-date.

 It allows you to select a player, toggle player status, and select a favourite from a list using the touch screen.

 Continuously shows the currently playing song info (with 1 minute intervals).

 Lasts many days on a single battery charge.
